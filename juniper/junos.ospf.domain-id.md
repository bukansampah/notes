This extended community ID can then be carried across the BGP VPN backbone. When the route is redistributed back as an OSPF or OSPFv3 route on the PE router and advertised to the CE near the destination, the domain ID identifies which domain the route originated from. The routing instance checks incoming routes for the domain ID. The route is then propagated as either a Type 3 LSA or Type 5 LSA.

When a PE router receives a route, it redistributes and advertises the route as either a Type 3 LSA or a Type 5 LSA, depending on the following:
* If the receiving PE router sees a Type 3 route with a matching domain ID, the route is redistributed and advertised as a Type 3 LSA.
* If the receiving PE router sees a Type 3 route without a domain ID (the extended attribute field of the routeâ€™s BGP update does not include a domain ID), the route is redistributed and advertised as a Type 3 LSA.
* If the receiving PE router sees a Type 3 route with a non-matching domain ID, the route is redistributed and advertised as a Type 5 LSA.
* If the receiving PE router sees a Type 3 route with a domain ID, but the router does not have a domain ID configured, the route is redistributed and advertised as a Type 5 LSA.
* If the receiving PE router sees a Type 5 route, the route is redistributed and advertised as a Type 5 LSA, regardless of the domain ID.

On the local PE router, the prefix of the directly connected PE/CE interface is an active direct route. This route is also an OSPF or OSPFv3 route.

In the VRF export policy, the direct prefix is exported to advertise the route to the remote PE. This route is injected as an AS-External-LSA, much as when a direct route is exported into OSPF or OSPFv3.

Domain ID ensures that an originated summary LSA arrives at the remote PE as a summary LSA. Domain ID does not translate AS-external-LSAs into summary LSAs.
